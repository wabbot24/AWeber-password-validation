# AWeber-password-validation

To run:

- Download code
- Run an npm install
- npm run build
- npm run start

That should get the app running in your default browser.

I decided to make the assignment a bit more interesting, using state to update validation on every keystroke, allowing me to tie those state variables to CSS styles to give the user feedback on their validation as they type instead of waiting until after they submit. The list of password requirements will turn green as they're met, and the submit button will remain greyed out until the user has a fully valid submission. Appropriate feedback will print on submission.
